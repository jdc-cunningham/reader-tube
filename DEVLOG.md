features
- [ ] speech length shows progress bar (easy with an mp3 file)
- [ ] fake video player window (maybe)
- [ ] use a current TTS that sounds human
- [ ] animate SVG character that looks better than 3 fps animation
- [ ] visuals
- [ ] the anime character eats the text, literally takes it off the DOM page now that would be neat
  - this would be an injected extension though

Why...

I came across this thing "OpenStep" precursor OS to MacOS from NeXT

I want to read this but I don't want to actually read it

I like finding YouTube videos that are educational in the code/hardware space

So this thing will take in text, and animate a speaking anime character (of course)

I can just load up text to it

I will search for TTS providers for something that sounds nice

But the first iteration will just use the web's TTS (which is terrible)

I'm trying to pick a base character design on Waifu Labs

Will have to cook soon in 30 mins

Wow the live preview of an image as you type it in MD is cool VS Code is OP

This character is easy for me to change the design since it's flat... no tone

Eyes/mouth can be changed to lines for talking/smiling

I was gonna develop this with ReactJS but it's overkill
